# To Do

A Basic Vanilla JavaScript To Do list.  Kind of pointless.  Initializing with NPM Init was overkill, as was using Bootstrap, but I wanted a little more experience playing with those two things.

A To Do list is a great little project, I'm probably going to make one in Angular and React later, just to have a bit of a better understanding of those frameworks.  I know I wouldn't normally pull out a framework for a little thing like this.
